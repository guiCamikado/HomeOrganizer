## 💡 Objective

In many households, **nobody knows exactly who is responsible for what**, well at least in mine... Which leads to confusion and delays.  
**Home Organizer** solves this problem by allowing users to:

- Manage household tasks clearly.  
- Assign responsibilities to each person.  
- Track pending, completed, and prioritized tasks.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

This project was developed with a focus on **clean architecture, usability, and scalability**:

- **Backend:** Python with **Flask** – handling routes, business logic, and APIs.  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – interactive and responsive interface.  
- **Design Architecture:** **Atomic Design** – ensuring reusable components and maintainable code.  
- **Data Storage:** Simple in-memory storage (no database required) for quick deployment and testing.

## 🔹 Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks with assigned users.  
- View pending and completed tasks.  
- Prioritize tasks and track progress.  
- Reusable and modular frontend components following **Atomic Design** principles.
